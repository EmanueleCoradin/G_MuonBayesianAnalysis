# Bayesian Analysis of the μ+ and μ− Lifetime in Aluminum

## Overview

This project aims to determine the lifetimes of positive (μ+) and negative (μ−) muons in aluminum through both conventional and Bayesian analysis methods. The given dataset contains the time elapsed between the implantation of the muon and its subsequent decay.
